#### Data Source

The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness . The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.

```{r getData}
link = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tianyl27/543_coursework_1/main/WHR2021.csv'

# getting the data TABLE from the file:
WHRData2021 <- read.csv(file=url(link))
```

#### Information of Variables
This dataset contains data such as the various countries selected, their rigion, their final ladder score, log of GDP per capita, index of social support, healthy life expectancy, index of freedom of making life choices, index of generosity, index of perception of corruption, respective populations in the year 2019 and 2020, total COVID-19 deaths in each of these countries, the median age in the corresponding countries considered, whether it is an island or not, index of exposure to COVID-19 infections in other countries as of march 31, whether a female head of government or not and so on. 


```{r}
# Get some information on the data
head(WHRData2021)
# summary(WHRData2021)
```
The variable of ladder score is the happiness level for each country. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. 

#### Data exploration


```{r unique, eval=FALSE}
# how many unique countries
length(unique(WHRData2021$Country.name))
```
There are 148 countries in this dataset.
```{r}
# aggregate countries by region
Countries=aggregate(data=WHRData2021,
                         Country.name~Regional.indicator,
                         FUN=length)
Countries
```
We now can see the number of countries for each region.

#### 1. [Practice] Picture of Country Population 

##### 1.1 Get the population number (country level)  
```{r}
# get population data
pop2020 = cbind(WHRData2021[,1:2],WHRData2021[,21:22])

# delete rows with na values: None
pop2020 = pop2020[complete.cases(pop2020),]
```

##### 1.2 Order by 2020 population to get information of countries with most populations.  
```{r}
# order by population in 2020 and show the first 20 countries
pop2020=pop2020[order(-pop2020$Population.2020),]
head(pop2020,20)
```
The top 5 countires are China, India, United States, Indonesia and Pakistan.  

##### 1.3 Calculate the cumulated number and percentages.
```{r}
# convert total population number into millions
pop2020$Population.2020 = pop2020$Population.2020/1000000
pop2020$Population.2019 = pop2020$Population.2019/1000000
# calculate the percentage, cumulative percentage and the cumulative population for each country
pop2020$Percent2020=pop2020$Population.2020/sum(pop2020$Population.2020)
pop2020$PercentCum=cumsum(pop2020$Percent)
pop2020$Pop2020Cum=cumsum(as.numeric(pop2020$Population.2020))
# calculate the changing rate in 2020
pop2020$Pop.change = pop2020$Population.2020 - pop2020$Population.2019
pop2020$Pop.change.rate = pop2020$Pop.change/pop2020$Population.2019
# see some:
head(pop2020,10)
```

##### 1.4 Get the list of countries that make up 80% and 50% of the world's population.
```{r}
countries80 = pop2020[pop2020$PercentCum<0.8,"Country.name"]
length(countries80)
countries50 = pop2020[pop2020$PercentCum<0.5,"Country.name"]
length(countries50)
countries_80= pop2020[pop2020$PercentCum<0.8,]
```
30 countries (20.3%) in this dataset make up 80% of the population and 5 countries (3.4%) make up for 50%.

##### 1.5 Plot the picture
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# draw a picture of countries with top 30 population
base1=ggplot(data=countries_80,
             aes(x=Country.name, Population.2020, fill=Pop.change.rate)) + theme_classic() + scale_x_discrete(limits=countries_80$Country.name) + theme(axis.text.y = element_text(face=ifelse(countries_80$Country.name%in%countries50,"bold","plain"))) + xlab("Country") + ylab("Population[millions]") 


bar1=base1 + geom_bar(stat = "identity",color='grey90',
                      aes(fill=PercentCum<0.5),
                      show.legend = F) +  coord_flip()
bar1

# title text
title1="Population for each country in 2020"
subtitle1="The top 30 countries which represent 80% of the whole population"
# Add the title and subtitle
bar2 = bar1 + scale_fill_manual(values=c(NA,"grey90")) + labs(title=title1, 
                                                              subtitle=subtitle1)+ theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.3),
                                                                                         plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.15))

bar2
```


```{r}
library(ggQC)
# draw a pareto picture
base2=ggplot(data=countries_80,
             aes(x=Country.name,y=Population.2020)) + theme_classic()+ scale_x_discrete(limits=countries_80$Country.name)

# This is just a practice of this function.
# The picture doesn't have much meaning because the pareto distribution is based on the top 30 countries, not the whole world.
pare1=base2 + stat_pareto() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, 
                                                               hjust = 1, face=ifelse(countries_80$Country.name%in%countries50,"bold","plain")))

#### 2. Average Life Expectancy for each reagion
*This is the picture for assignment 1.*  

##### 2.1 Aggregate the number by region and order it by the result
```{r}
# aggregate 'Healthy.life.expectancy' by 'Regional.indicator'
LifeExp_countries=aggregate(data=WHRData2021,
                         Healthy.life.expectancy~Regional.indicator,
                         FUN=mean)
# get standard error 
LifeExp_sd=aggregate(data=WHRData2021,
                         Healthy.life.expectancy~Regional.indicator,
                         FUN=sd)
# merge two dataframe
LifeExp_countries = merge(LifeExp_countries,LifeExp_sd, by='Regional.indicator')
# rename the columns
colnames(LifeExp_countries) = c('Region', 'LifeExp','LifeExpStd')



# order by the average life expectancy
LifeExp_countries=LifeExp_countries[order(-LifeExp_countries$LifeExp),]
write.table(LifeExp_countries,"table1.csv",row.names=FALSE,col.names=TRUE,sep=",")
```
Western Europe has the highest average life expectancy.

##### 2.2 Plot the picture
```{r}
# title and caption text
TitleText = "Average Healthy Life Expectancy"
CaptionText = "Source: https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2021/"

# draw a picture of average life expectancy for each region
base3 = ggplot(data=LifeExp_countries, aes(x=Region, y=LifeExp))+ theme_classic() + xlab("Region") + ylab("Healthy Life Expectancy") + scale_x_discrete(limits=LifeExp_countries$Region)
# base3 = ggplot(data=LifeExp_countries, aes(x=Region, y=LifeExp, fill=LifeExp))+ theme_classic()+scale_fill_gradient(low = "cornsilk", high = "coral") + xlab("Region") + ylab("Healthy Life Expectancy") + scale_x_discrete(limits=LifeExp_countries$Region)

# Get the average life expectancy for the whole world
avg_LifeExp = mean(WHRData2021$Healthy.life.expectancy)
low_regions=LifeExp_countries[LifeExp_countries$LifeExp<avg_LifeExp,"Region"]
low_regions

annotation1=paste0('World Average:',round(avg_LifeExp,2))
LifeExpMin = min(LifeExp_countries$LifeExp)
LifeExpMax = max(LifeExp_countries$LifeExp)
annotation2=paste0('Min:',round(LifeExpMin,2))
annotation3=paste0('Max:',round(LifeExpMax,2))


bar3 = base3 + geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge", aes(fill=LifeExp<avg_LifeExp), show.legend = F)+scale_fill_manual(values=c("grey","coral")) + ylim(0,80)

# add title and caption 
bar4 = bar3 + coord_flip() + labs(title=TitleText, caption=CaptionText) + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0), plot.caption = element_text(hjust = -1))+ theme(axis.text.y = element_text(face=ifelse(LifeExp_countries$Region%in%low_regions,"bold","plain")))

# add errorbar which shows the within-group variability
#bar5 = bar4 + geom_errorbar(aes(ymax = LifeExp+LifeExpStd, ymin = LifeExp-LifeExpStd), position = position_dodge(0.8),width=0.1,alpha=0.5) 

#bar5



# add annotations
bar6 = bar4 + geom_hline(yintercept = round(avg_LifeExp,2), linetype=3, size=1, alpha=0.8)+ annotate(geom = 'text',label=annotation1,y = avg_LifeExp,x=5.5,angle=0) + annotate(geom = 'text',label=annotation2,y = LifeExpMin,x=10,angle=0) + annotate(geom = 'text',label=annotation3,y = LifeExpMax,x=1,angle=0)+theme(legend.position='none')

bar6
#ANZ: Australia and New Zealand
```
Several findings:  
a) Western Europe has both the highest average life expectancy and the least in-group variance.  
b) Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest average life expectancy.  
c) Regions in Asia tend to have higher variance.  
d) Four resgions have lower life expectency than the average value for the whole world
The healthy life expectency is an important indicator which influences the citizens' feeling of happiness greatly. From the perspective of global health, more resources should be put into increase the health system in regions and countries with a comparatively low life expectency.
